Firstly, classes encapsulate both data and behavior into a single unit, promoting code organization and clarity. Secondly, classes support abstraction by hiding implementation details behind well-defined interfaces, simplifying the usage of complex systems. Additionally, classes enable inheritance and polymorphism, facilitating code reuse and modularity. Furthermore, classes allow for the creation of multiple instances with unique characteristics and behaviors, enhancing flexibility and modeling capabilities. Lastly, classes provide namespace management, preventing naming conflicts and promoting code clarity, particularly in large projects with multiple contributors."
