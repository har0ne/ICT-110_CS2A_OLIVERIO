        "1. Self-written modulesin Python offer several benefits. They promote modularity by organizing code into separate units, enhancing maintenance and readability. Additionally, they enable code reuse across projects, saving time and effort. Encapsulation hides internal details, promoting abstraction and preventing unintended side effects. Modules also aid in namespace management, avoiding naming collisions and ensuring clarity. Furthermore, docstrings provide valuable documentation on usage, enhancing understanding and maintainability.\n",

        "\n",
        "2. The preffered way of importing a module in Python is using the \"import\" statement. It is used like this \"import module_name\". This way is what's preffered because it maintains code readability, avoids ambiguity, makes it easier for the coder to reference, and it promotes namespace management.\n",
